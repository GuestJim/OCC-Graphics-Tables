13,Minimum Acceptable - Notes,,,,"80 with 30% Sharpening looks good
90 without Sharpening looks good to the point I couldn't tell you it wasn't 100
70 with 50+ Sharpening at a distance (like my television) would be acceptable",The impact is hard to see so Off is minimum,"Off results in a lot of visible aliasing, but the image is definitely sharper
Off with 110 Resolution Scaling looks quite good. A lot of the aliasing on Nomad was gone, but does hurt performance",,,,,,"At first analysis, the impact can be seen, but is not that significant at the Review Settings",See Resolution Scaling and Anti-Aliasing notes,A lot of shadows are coming from the AO system (at least outside in the day) so you definitely want it on,honestly cannot tell you the difference it makes,"If you have to do Low, you can
Medium is significantly better",,"There is an impact, but you can live with them Off","It appears to control the terrain texture quality
the texture quality is clearly better on Medium than Low
at High things like footprints in the snow is added, so recommend High


Based on the VRAM usage numbers in-game menu, Low, Medium-High, Very High, and Ultra are texture quality steps
the Medium and High step is the visual effect of footprints, at the least","It appears the options influence density, but not the specific quality of the vegetation I am looking at
this makes Low a comfortable minimum","The differences between the options are hard for me to spot, so Low and not bothering with a maximum","Low still has the shadows so it doesn't fail
High has better thickness to shadows of thin objects
Couldn't tell you difference between Low and Medium, and then High and Very High",,Personal Choice,Personal Choice,"If there is a difference in gameplay, it is hard to spot, so Off for minimum
I do feel you can probably safely have it off",Couldn't tell you the difference it makes,,Couldn't tell you there's a difference
14,Maximum Acceptable,,,,,Off,On,,,,,,FidelityFX CAS,,Very High,,,16,On,Ultra,Very High,,Ultra,,,,,,,
15,Maximum Acceptable - Notes,,,,,"The impact is hard to see even when On, so it is Off.
At 90% resolution scale, it actually made the image look softer","It does help remove aliasing, but does soften the image some and does miss some aliasing too
Sharpening (50) does help return some of the details softened away by the AA",,,,,,,,"Medium and High appear to use one method
Very High and Ultra appear to use a different method
these different methods can be obvious between each other, but the differences within the methods are harder to spot",,,,Have noticed a shadow artifact that is related to this setting,"Can see a difference between Very High and Ultra
it is detail in snow that I am spotting
it is a small difference, but I am seeing it at 2048x1152, so a higher resolution display might show it better

between High and Very High, you can also spot differences between the textures details, in some but not all locations","Can't spot difference between Very High and Ultra
Can see difference between High and Very High (Very High is much denser)",,"Very clear improvement on Ultra
Ultra defintiely has the highest resolution to the shadows",,,,Skipping maximum as it might be apparent in close-ups during conversations,,,
