# OCC-Graphics-Tables
Tables of graphics settings and options for various games.

This repository is to publicly share a collection I have started of the graphics settings and options for various games.
Additionally, these tables will record the options selected when I review a game and those that represent the 'Minimum Acceptable' definition I have also been recording.
Minimum Acceptable options are those that below which a game's visual quality is too significantly decreased. An easy example for something below that level, and thus is not acceptable, would be removing shadows from a game. The idea is that if you must lower the options, or just want to for performance gains, these are the options I feel one should try to not go below.
