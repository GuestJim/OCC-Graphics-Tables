12,Minimum Acceptable - Notes,,"There is clear aliasing at Off, enough of it is temporal that FXAA doesn't help so TAA it must be, if you want any in-game AA
Unfortunately, TAA does introduce ghosting and does soften the image some. So your choice is aliasing or no aliasing with these artifacts.","4x has a clear impact, improving over 2x","Finally spotted a difference that I consider minor, so Low is the minimum","Low does not disable shadows, so it is acceptable
However its resolution is low enough for aliasing to be clear on the shadows.
Medium is noticeably better
High is also noticeably better than Medium, but you can still see some.","There is a visual impact from turning on, as now cars can be seen in puddles, but there is some noise to these reflections, and the possibility of some aliasing, so while Yes is the Maximum, it's really up to the player","Off for the Minimum because the normal shadows cover a lot already so you can get away without AO
But, go to Low if you can.",,,"Off is Minimum because DOF is something I feel is personal choice to begin with.
It only appears to impact when zooming in with a weapon.",do NOT turn this Off,,"It does sharpen but when combined with TAA it produces enough of a contrast between TAA's softening during motion and when still that you can see the inconsistency, so recommend keeping off."

14,Maximum Acceptable - Notes,,,,Medium looks better than Low and High looks better than Medium. With High we get more foliage appearing at a greater distance,High is noticeably better than Medium and it is a positive impact,,High definitely has a visual impact and is better than Medium,,"When in the tank, I noticed a jitter to the blur of a symbol on its hatch, which is not what I want to see with blur enabled, hence why I recommend it being off.
(Patch could improve)","High is the maximum as it appears the samples used for the blur filter are greater than at Low and Medium. Basically, I can see aliasing within the blur at Low and while Medium is better I feel High is best",,,
