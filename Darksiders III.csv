8,"Minimum Acceptable - Notes

below these settings, the quality loss is too significant",,,"Definitely not Low (looks like shadows are off)

Appears Medium-Epic, difference is LOD distance","High, as it gets rid of the artifacting

However, Medium does a not bad job, but leaves some artifacting.
Noticed the Rider's Mercy talisam looks to be at a lower resolution on Medium, based on the aliasing of it, so recommend High

Low has a lot of aliasing. Thinking Low is without AA
Medium is with FXAA","Low (from Maker's Forge)

Can see more foliage being rendered at Medium and High, but not really needed
Unsure what Epic and Cinematic give you",Low because I can't see a difference between Low and Epic (at Maker's Forge),"Setting seems to control Ambient Occlusion

Low appears to be AO off, so not desired as here AO is evident

Medium is AO on, and above this I couldn't tell you the difference is worth it","Low because it meets the Minimum Acceptable standard

Both Low and Medium seem to pulse some effects on and off, Medium pulses on more rapidly
High pulses less often and some effects are always on
Epic does not appear to pulse at all","Low by MA standard
seems to be decorative foliage is gone, so looks different but not strictly bad

Medium and up add more foliage, making it look better

Should be more of a Ground Decoration label than foliage
Run Medium if you can, to give world more character"
