Of course, I do not need it at all, as both CPUs are capable of Ultra easily.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Day 1 update invalidates some of the below
Low looks pretty good on its own, even better with MSAA at 4X, FXAA Off, and Anisotropic Filtering at 16X

Low with those changes, and GPU Memory Ultra looks better than what I played at. I wish I had known so I could be enjoying this performance and this visual quality

post-release
Lowest looks okay, might be from looking at television, might be from release day patch","This setting appears to control resolution scaling, based on when it is below native resolution, FidelityFX CAS becomes Rescale Filtering

For monitor (2048x1152) 900p was Minimum, but for 1920x1080 television, 720p looked okay, but I also sit four feet away, so not a perfect situation","None because the aliasing is not that bad, but is present so turn it on if you can",,,"I will almost always recommend disabling FXAA as it does soften the image
For antialiasing, use MSAA",,None looks bad so 2x is my minimum,,,"None because you do not necessarily need it, but it can be nice to have

Day 1 update invalidates some of the below
I find AO to have one of the largest impacts on performance, but at Low still looks pretty good without being too bad
Medium is probably doable, but its impact is present",,,,,"Lowest is minimum because it still has shadows, but they clearly look poor

Day 1 update invalidates some of the below
Easily has the largest impact on performance, so go to Low if you need to
Cannot say I can see a difference from Medium, but performacne does take a hit at that point in some situations",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Lowest is minimum because it still looks alright, but Low is definitely better",,,,,,

19,Maximum Acceptable - Notes,,,,,,"When at Full, which includes scene and depth prepass, there is a shadow-like artifact, but this is not the case at Scene.
However, while Scene lacks this, the gun and hand look markedly worse, so you still do not want to use it, except maybe in combination with SSAA, but that is kind of contrary to the point.
Without this artifact though, it took SSAA 4x from ~60 FPS while standing still to around 100 FPS, so very impressive in that regard.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Ultra is noticeably, if not significantly different from High, earning it the Maximum",,"2x, 4x, and 8x all do increasingly better jobs addressing the aliasing, including a temporal example I spotted",,,,,"4x appears to be the sweet spot, at least for A Breakfast in France
8x looks better than 4x and 16x I think looks better, but it might not be enough to matter",,,"Ultra looks the best, as the shadow is the most consistent
All other levels have an amount of blotchiness, but it does get better with each level.",,,,,"Maximum produces very sharp shadows, almost like 1:1 sampling is being used",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Unsure of difference between Ultra and High, but will leave Ultra as maximum, on faith it is different and that higher resolutions will show this.

Day 1 update invalidates some of the below
The difference is significant and obvious between Ultra and High. The example I could see of lower quality textures was immediately fixed by going to Ultra.

High now behaves correctly, with how textures are streamed in
It also now says Ultra is more than my card may handle",,,,,,
