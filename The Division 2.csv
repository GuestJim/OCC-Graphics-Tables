1,Setting Description,Set whether game runs full-screen or windowed,Set the resolution for the game,Set the rate at which the display is refreshed,Set the primary monitor for the game,"Reduces input latency, but may cause lower frame rate",Enable DX12 Render. Requires Windows 10 or newer. Requires a restart.,,,,Change the brightness of the game,Adjust the contrast.,Sync the display of the scene to the refresh rate of the monitor to avoid screen tearing. Turning this option off can increase performance significantly.,"Limit the framerate to achieve consistent graphics and network performance. This prevents jitters when aiming, shooting, and moving due to frame rate fluctuations.",Set a custom framerate limit,Set the level of quality of shadows for objects in the scene.,Set the number of spotlight shadows that can appear onscreen.,Set the level of resoluion on shadows created by spotlights,"Set the quality of contact-shadowing of direct lighting for objects in the scene, making objects feel grounded rather than floating",Adjusts the resolution at which the scene renders. Lowering the setting reduces the rendered resolution and increases performance. Raising the setting increases the rendered resolution and decreases performance.,Focus of soften all elements onscreen,"Set the quantity and quality of particles emitted by particle systems. The higher the setting, the more particles are present in the scene.","Set the rendering quality of fog volumes. The higher the setting, the better the fog quality.","Set the rendering frequency and resolution of global scene reflections produced by large scene objects, such as skyscrapers, mountains, and so forth",Set the rendering frequency and resolution of local scene reflections produced by objects nearby,Set the level of quality for vegetation,Turn on or off the transmission of light through translucent objects,Enhance the imge quality of textures on surfaces that are at oblique angles relative to the camera,Provide textures with a sense of depth without additional geometry,Set the quality of self-shadowing from ambient lighting for objects in the scene,Turn on or off the simulation of a camera's range of focus. Objects outside the range of focus are blurred.,"Adjust the geometric complexity for objects in-game. The higher the setting, the more detailed the object's geometry becomes.",Longer object streming distance (uses more memory and HDD),Turn on or off the simulation of the internal reflections and scattering of light caused by a camera lens' non-uniform optical characteristics,Reduce the peripheral brightness of scenes. Turn on/off.,Set the quality level for water graphics,Turn chromatic shifts on the UI elements on or off,Set the resolution of projected textures.,Enabled high resolution sky textures,Set the quality level for terrain graphics.
