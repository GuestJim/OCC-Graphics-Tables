# OCC-Graphics-Tables
Tables of graphics settings and options for various games.

This repository is to publicly share a collection I have started of the graphics settings and options for various games.
Additionally, these tables will record the options selected when I review a game and those that represent the 'Minimum Acceptable' definition I have also been recording.
Minimum Acceptable options are those that below which a game's visual quality is too significantly decreased. An easy example for something below that level, and thus is not acceptable, would be removing shadows from a game. The idea is that if you must lower the options, or just want to for performance gains, these are the options I feel one should try to not go below.

There are also Maximum Acceptable options, which are counter in concept as it instead is about the point where the visual difference is not apparent or a 'Screenshot Difference' (meaning it requires comparing screenshots to notice). Neither Minimum nor Maximum Acceptable options are considering performance; only image quality based on my subjective opinion.
