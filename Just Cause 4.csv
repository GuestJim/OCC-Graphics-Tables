Not seeing benefit of 16x, so 8x probably best to stop at","On

FXAA or Temporal SMAA
Either method does help, so go with whichever you want
Temporal SMAA does do better, but is not perfect",Low looks good. Hard to see difference frome other settings,"Low is acceptable

Medium gives great visual improvement

don't see High and Very High improvement

2019-02-04
Low and Medium appear the same now, or at least I cannot spot the difference
Low and Medium lack the wakes behind water craft

High and Very High have the wake, but cannot distinguish between them.","No

unsure what it does","Low is acceptable, can't find difference","Medium

Low and Medium appear to have the same detail distances, but Low has such a worse resolution to the shadows I think Medium is the real minimum here","No

It makes a difference, but not critical",Personal Preference,"Adds a dark fade around the monitor/display edge. Really not necessary, so personal choice","Not seeing significant change

In one example, it makes things brighter that should be in shadow","No by definition
but the difference is apparent with water","Unconvinced it makes a significant impact

Found an example where it impacted presence of heat distortion"

12,Maximum Acceptable - Notes,,,"16x does give more detail at a distance, but is still not huge difference",I know Temporal SMAA offers better than FXAA already,There is a visible difference between High and Very High. Still somewhat discretionary.,High because cannot see impact of Very High,No because still don't know what it does,"Unsure of difference between High and Very High

Spotted difference, but is near Screenshot Difference level","There is a difference between High and Very High, but it is personal preference
It appears High and Very High use the same detail distance levels, but Very High has harder edges to the shadwos than High, so if you want softer shadow edges, High is more desirable

This seems to be the same difference between Low and Medium, though the LOD distance is smaller than High/Very High.",The difference is present,Personal Preference,"Adds a dark fade around the monitor/display edge. Really not necessary, so personal choice","Still no idea what it does, so see no reason to turn it on",The difference is visible,"Seems to control all Depth of Field, not just Bokeh effects"
