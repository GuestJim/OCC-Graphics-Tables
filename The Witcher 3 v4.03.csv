In one place the reflections really brightened an area, but I do not believe it should have been so brightened. It was an area of marsh-grass, so reasonably dense that was suddenly well illuminated as though they were not casting shadows, and there were clear and sharp reflections off of the water to illuminate some of these grass blades, again looking completely unnatural for such a dim, soft-lit day.","RT does add shadows for grass, but this can be acheived without RT so I'm not willing to give it to RT as a clear win.",,"FXAA didn't do better than Off
With dynamic resolution disabled, I can't say sharpening is required for TAAU, so that is certainly the minimum without FSR/DLSS

With FSR Performance, there is no temporal instability worth speaking of (had a single pixel unstable) while DLSS Performance had obvious distortion, like heat distortion. So for that option at 1920x1080, FSR wins based on stability.","Performance legitimately impresses me as I cannot spot any artifacts or distortions from the lower resolution being upscaled.
DLSS even at Balanced had temporal stability issues, so this is really impressive.
Plus, this is approaching double performance (from 65 to 115 FPS)","Balanced does have some temporal instability that is visible, but I can understand tolerating it for the performance you want.

Quality is free of this instability, from what I saw while testing it. That is what I would recommend, but can understand going to Balanced, if necessary.

We have crisp and detailed reflections in very wet mud. This should be a rough surface that scatters far more than it reflects, and yet...","The foliage shadows are nice to have, so happy about that, but I'm unconvinced on it in general.
The RT shadows were also generally sharper than the normal shadows, which all have soft edges, but that's okay. It is horizontal image quality

Did observe at Oxenfurt a shadow being cast with RT without anything to cast it. Look at the bridge in the screenshots. The Sun is to the right and behind me, so the shadow is cast on what is directly illuminated by the Sun.","On is the maximum because visually, it does look good
But, for gameplay purposes, this is still horizontal movement/screenshot difference
Things do look a little better with the v4.03 update, but can still find where RTAO brightens an area.","TAAU because it can be enabled without lowering the render resolution.

FSR2 and DLSS are at parity to my eyes, at 1920x1080. FSR2 is more stable when paused. DLSS might be preserving some details better at motion. Still, the performance improvement looked similar between them, and the image quality was definitely similar, so use whichever you wish, if you must use them.

FSR 2 wins for temporal stability, that both of the others lack, and preserves detail well
XeSS suffers from some temporal instability, though it looks a bit better than DLSS, preserves some details better than DLSS, and even FSR, but it also over-reconstructs the scene in some places, adding mass to shapes that shouldn't really have it. It's like it's trying to hallucinate the frame.
DLSS has temporal instability issues, and completely smudged away some detail, and looks like it is over sharpening in some areas.
with motion
FSR 2 has some polygon popping and does have a softer image, like the image being from a lower resolution, but Sharpening at Low helps with that.
XeSS looks softer, I think from ghosting/that over-reconstruction mentioned above
DLSS does have some ghosting still, but does not need any sharpening
Personally I prefer FSR 2 (quality) with Low Sharpening to DLSS Quality, no extra sharpennig, because while there is some polygon popping with FSR, it is not always present and evident, but DLSS has some ghosting that is more common, but still not too bad.
	really is a personal choice at this level.
XeSS does perform a little worse than FSR 2 and DLSS. FSR and DLSS are at performance parity from what I've seen, but XeSS is a little behind, like 110 instead of 120.
Also noticed during a light rain shower, all three and TAAU basically remove the rain. That's kind of a problem.",Quality is the maximum because it is the maximum option. No artifacts or instability to speak of.,Quality is the maximum option but also the only one that did not show any instability.,"I can see some temporal instability with XeSS, even at Ultra Quality when paused. It isn't that bad though, and I think a little better than DLSS (Quality to Quality) like the extremes are less far apart than DLSS, but the instability itself has the same nature.

",,"Actually unsure Low is doing anything, it might be subtle, but definitely saw oversharpening with High that I'd rather avoid.","Off is like a more subtle version of shadows being off (but they are not), so On does look better, but if you have to turn it off, you can.
(v4.01 above)

Between SSAO and HBAO+, HBAO+ certainly looks better in part because it applies ground shadows from foliage. They are not the most accurate, but they are there and it is a positive impact on the image quality.","Low kind of looks like it might be Off, but that's not too bad. You can live without those. High does still look good, so that is the maximum.

Noticed in v4.03, but might be present in other versions, this causing a significant performance hit in some situations when on High. It is a good thing that it does not seem to be completely necessary.",,,,,,,,,,"Geralt because his hair looks fine with it, but at least a bear's hair looks worse with it, in my opinion.",No maximum because I can't see a difference but am willing to acknowledge there is one I'm not seeing,No maximum because I can't see a difference but am willing to acknowledge there is one I'm not seeing,,,,,"Ultra+ is the maximum, but diminishing returns above High","High is maximum acceptable because the difference from Medium is visible. Ultra and Ultra+ do continue to increase the density, but it is unclear/subtle so likely not worth it.","High, Ultra, and Ultra+ are hard to see differences between, but I am willing to believe that can exist at higher resolutions and willing to defer to the GPU's management of the textures and Anisotropic Filtering (I'm assuming is baked in) at Ultra+ to give you good image quality without any hassle.",
