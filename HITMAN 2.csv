At least on Miami, the difference between Low and Ultra is not much, so should be happy with Low

Medium
in one spot, could see the impact this has over Low (Isle of Sgail)

High 


Ultra","Low
looks good (Miami)
not horrible, but going to Normal will be best (Mumbai)

Normal 
looks better than low, but uses ~4 GB on Miami
definitely best for clothing details (Isle of Sgail)

High
looks best but over 4 GB","Trilinear
Avoid if you can

Anisotropic 4x
probably where you should start (Miami)
not always good enough though (Mumbai)

Anisotropic 8x
looks good so you can be happy
gets you some detail otherwise lost (Mumbai)

Anisotropic 16x
looks best, should use

","Off
it is noticeable on Maimi, but not a horrible loss","Low
just tolerable, go higher if you can

Medium
Is good and no problem if this is what you need to do

High
Is better for 'real' things

Ultra
is best for all things

Could believe High and Ultra only differ in what they apply to, not the quality of the 'real' shadows",,"Only the 'real' people, who appear in the mini-map have shadows at distance. The non-real people lose them at medium distance.",,,,,

11,Minimum Acceptable - 2.12 - Notes,,,,,,,,,,,,,Believe there to be little noticable visual impact from On,"Low is the minimal acceptable by definition

Medium and High both appear to use some kind of temporal filter (amotizied supersampling related, I think) to improve the final reflection quality. However, they do suffer from a ghosting artifact when moving.","Still personal choice
could not notice the difference myself","Honestly, it is very hard to spot any difference with it off or on, so Off",It is already set to detect the number of cores you have and set itself accordingly. Just go with that.
