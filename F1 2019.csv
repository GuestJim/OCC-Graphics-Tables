13,Minimum Acceptable - Notes,,,"It doesn't necessarily look that bad without any anti-aliasing.
CMAA2 doesn't really seem to do much, so I would skip it for TAA Checkboard or TAA.","Off because it is doable. You can tell the textures/road is a lot softer, but it does work and doesn't look too bad.","Low changes the characteristics of albedo of some surfaces, causing them to lose color","Unsure what the differences are for certain, making testing difficult/inappropriate","Ultra Low is technically accepabtle, but if you can do Low, it is noticeably better with a higher resolution shadow map",Unsure of example,Off because you do not really need them,"Low is the appropriate minimum with only the nearest of the crowd being animated, since at speed you may not notice them anyway.
However, Medium I think would be where I would aim for if computer is up to it.","Low clearly looks worse, as though the lighting setting for the reflection is turned down, but these are a small section of the frame, so it isn't unacceptable.",Do we really need this,Unsure of example,Unsure of example,No easy way to controllably test,"The effects are there on Low, and look good","Controls the vegetation and likely other assets, but these are not really necessary, so Low removing them is not too great an issue","Off because you do not really need skidmarks, but they are nice to have",Unsure what it does,Shouldn't have visual impact'

15,Maximum Acceptable - Notes,,,"There is some softening with TAA, but it also does a very good job of addressing the aliasing","The steps do appear to be make visual differences, so use what you are comfortable with.
Can still get away without it if you wish.

Might as well go to the max","Not doubting a difference, but cannot spot between Medium and above","Unsure what the differences are for certain, making testing difficult/inappropriate","Can see the difference between High and Ultra High
Ultra High does appear sharper, but not inappropriately sharp.",Unsure of example,"Low adds in particle effects nicely
could not spot the difference between Low, Medium, and High. Though they may exist, I just cannot see them.","It appears the setting controls the distance for replacing static models with animated ones, so the higher the option, the further away you will see the crowd moving.","There are clear differences between the options, so Ultra High is the maximum","Did spot the difference with it enabled, and ASSAO did show a difference from HBAO+, making it the maximum, but I still feel it is not necessary",Unsure of example,Unsure of example,No easy way to controllably test,Cannot spot difference between High and Ultra High,"Unsure what differences are above Medium, which does have a clear impact, but these higher options may still have an impact I do not see","Not really spotting a difference between Low and High. Might be a matter of distance before they disappear, in which case I could believe Low is enough.",Unsure what it does,Shouldn't have visual impact'
