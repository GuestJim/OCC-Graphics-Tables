8,Minimum Acceptable - Notes,,,"Even 2x makes a difference

Not seeing benefit of 16x, so 8x probably best to stop at","On

FXAA or Temporal SMAA
Either method does help, so go with whichever you want
Temporal SMAA does do better, but is not perfect",Low looks good. Hard to see difference frome other settings,"Low is acceptable

Medium gives great visual improvement

don't see High and Very High improvement","No

unsure what it does","Low is acceptable, can't find difference","Medium

Low makes even the closer shadows soft

Cannot see the detail edge for Very High","No

It makes a difference, but not critical",Personal Preference,"Adds a dark fade around the monitor/display edge. Really not necessary, so personal choice","No

Not seeing significant change

In one example, it makes things brighter that should be in shadow","No

by definition
but the difference is apparent with water","No

Unconvinced it makes a significant impact

Found an example where it impacted presence of heat distortion"
