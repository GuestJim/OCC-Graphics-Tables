Appears Medium-Epic, difference is LOD distance","High, as it gets rid of the artifacting

However, Medium does a not bad job, but leaves some artifacting.
Noticed the Rider's Mercy talisam looks to be at a lower resolution on Medium, based on the aliasing of it, so recommend High

Low has a lot of aliasing. Thinking Low is without AA
Medium is with FXAA

Appears the artifacting observed with lighting has been fixed for Medium making
Medium
the new minimium","Low (from Maker's Forge)

Can see more foliage being rendered at Medium and High, but not really needed
Unsure what Epic and Cinematic give you",Low because I can't see a difference between Low and Epic (at Maker's Forge),"Setting seems to control Ambient Occlusion

Low appears to be AO off, so not desired as here AO is evident

Medium is AO on, and above this I couldn't tell you the difference is worth it","Low because it meets the Minimum Acceptable standard

Both Low and Medium seem to pulse some effects on and off, Medium pulses on more rapidly
High pulses less often and some effects are always on
Epic does not appear to pulse at all","Low by MA standard
seems to be decorative foliage is gone, so looks different but not strictly bad

Medium and up add more foliage, making it look better

Should be more of a Ground Decoration label than foliage
Run Medium if you can, to give world more character"

10,Maximum Acceptable - Notes,,,"High appears to have a higher resolution to the shadows than Medium. Can observe polygon popping for the shadows on Medium.

Slight change in near-view between High and Epic (Screenshot Difference)
Epic is better for shadows at distance, but still Screenshot Distance.
Epic because best distance","High is noticeably better than Medium
High has a certain softness for motion, but this is not present for Epic. This difference is noticeable and this Epic is an acceptable maximum",Can see difference between Low and Medium and High. Cannot see difference between High and Epic though at Maker's Forge,"Cannot spot difference between Low and anything else (tested comparing to Epic at Marker's Forge)
Might be resolution dependent for experience","Cannot spot difference between Medium and High
Can see better shadowing between High and Epic, like foliage casting shadows. This is a minor difference, but is present and noticeable","Epic removes pulsing to the effects.
High is still good looking, but the difference is present and better than Screenshot Difference","Epic because better than Screenshot Difference, but is eye-candy so unnecessary"
