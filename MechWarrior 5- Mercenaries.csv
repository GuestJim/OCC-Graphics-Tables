9,Minimum Acceptable - Notes,,,,"DLSS is actually doing a good job, even at Performance
I am quite impressed by it here, at least in the hangar",,,,"(Was bugged, fixed prior to release)
Things like mountains and structures are still present at Low, but the small rocks decorating the ground and some larger rocks even, and some destructibles on top of strucutres (like antennas) will be missing on Low until you get close enough.
Still, I feel like Low is acceptable as the big stuff is still there and looks fine.","Definitely covers particle effects

Before seeing something getting shot, Low looks fine but is clearly missing effects
Medium has these effects but turned down, making it better

Low/Medium: Low still looks good but Medium does add to it, so use it if you can, but Low is still good looking.","Low appears to turn off shadows
Cannot see Medium and Maximum begin different

Low wins Minimum because it is not bad for gameplay for shadows to be missing",Have not spotted difference yet,"On Low there is less of the misc. objects around the ground, like ice debris and others, but the small rock/pebble things are present.
Feeling like Low is acceptable
On a Forest map (above was Snow map) the trees remain at Low, but the grass, shrubs, and rocks are gone.

It appears foliage covers things like grass and tree quality, but also anything that is a physics object but when destroyed is removed, instead of leaving some ruin","No idea what the difference is

Upon close inspection of mech leg in dropship, it appears Ambient Occlusion is controlled by this, but can't say I care about it given the normal perspective for gameplay (in cockpit or over the mech shoulder)",Just do not want to use FXAA. It very noticeably softens the image,"There is clear temporal aliasing at Low (assuming Off) and Medium does not address this. High does address this and Maximum too.
Medium and up does soften details that Low preserves

2020-04-21 Update
With TXAA, Medium does not address all of the aliasing
High does address the aliasing, but does suffer from ghosting","4x does look markedly better than 2x, which I am struggling to see its improvement over 0x","It is your choice if you want to use it, but it definitely succeeds at sharpening the image and compliments the softening of the AA options well.",,"Not really needed and actually inaccurate. The scenes can be completely overcast but we still get sharp-edged shadows, but when overcast if there are shadows, they should be soft.",Not really needed
10,Maximum Acceptable,,,,On,,,,Maximum,High,Medium,,High,,TXAA,Maximum,16x,On,,On,Off
11,Maximum Acceptable - Notes,,,,"When examining a Mech foot closely, Scaling at 66 with TXAA Maximum, and FidelityFX looked comparable to DLSS Quality

Cannot spot differences between Performance, Balanced, and Quality (in Hangar). Could be a resolution thing (as in need above 1080 to notice)
Did notice when firing the PPC, the effect of the shot is noticeably different with DLSS enabled. There is a loss of bloom around the bolt, which is there at full resolution and even when scaled to 66
The Medium Lasers are also impacted by using DLSS. They lose the speckling with DLSS on that is there otherwise (even on Quality)",,,,"There are clear levels between all options, making Maximum the best of them.
However, I feel Medium and Far both do a good job making Maximum, though better, not so strongly necessary.","High beats Medium because a flash from the PPC on Medium looks worse than on High (saw tearing in there on Medium but not on High).

Maximum did appear to have additional effects (for the PPC) over High, but cannot see it anymore, so going to High as the MAQ

Maximum does have more effects than high (with PPC see some extra warping) so there is a difference between it and High, but High I consider still acceptable","I cannot see the difference between Medium and High (at present)
Maximum too does not add anything noticeable",,"Medium on Forest maps shows grass (Low does not)
High shows more grass than Medium

Maximum did seem to be better for reason stated below, but after checking again, not seeing that reason being true any more, so High is MAQ


Maximum has better LOD than High (trees in distance were more detailed without zooming on Maximum than on High, and the difference between levels on High were significant and obvious)",,TXAA does address the aliasing and does not soften too badly,"On High there can be very clear ghosting, but Maximum does not suffer from this

2020-04-21 Update
Maximum does suffer from ghosting, but I feel it is still better than High, even if not by much","16x does have more detail than 8x in the textures, earning it Maximum AQ.
Given the angle you will see the world at so much, it makes sense to have this turned up",,,"The mech's shadows are clearly sharper when On, but cannot see improvements from High and Maximum","I honestly don't see the purpose to the reflections here. Not that much reflects with enough detail to warrant this

Spotted some reflections on the shoulder of my Orion, so you can see them on the mechs, but at 10 m is where I could really tell something. From a more reasonable 46 m, the difference is hardly worthwhile."
